
Generics  :
	Generics in java is very important concept.
	It nearly make our code bug free by chacking at compiler phase.
	Generic concept is use to make our class type safe.
	And by using Generic concept we can even get rid of downcasting.
	We can limit the number of data type our obj type our class can accept.
	We need to write the type of the class in between"<>" this symbol.
	
	
	
	Example ;

	class Generic<T>{
		T data ;
		
		public Generic(T t){
		this.data = t ;
		}
		
		public void fun1(T data){
		System.out.println(data) ;
		}
		}
		
		now in the above example when we will make object we can decide which type of object we want to create.
		this is very important topic.
