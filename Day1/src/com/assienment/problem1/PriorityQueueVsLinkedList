Priority Queue:
	It is a Collection which is present in java.util package.
	Priority Queue implements the collection and queue.
	Similar to the TreeSet it must implements comparable interface.
	Or it should implements Comparable.
	Otherwise it  will give class cast exeception.
	Priority Queue can not accept any null value.
	when we try to print elements it print it in unsorted order.
	but when we apply iterator it gives the elements in sequence.
	
	
	Example:
	
	Queue<Integer> integer = new PriorityQueue<>() ;
	Iterator itr = integer.iterator() ;
	while(itr.hasNext()){
		int num = itr.next() ;
		System.out.println(num) ;
		}
		
		
LinkedList :
	It is also a collection f/w. present in java.util package.
	LinkedList implements the collection List and Queue.
	It has property of List as well as Queue.
	It can accept a null value.
	It don't need to implements any other interface.
	it store element in the form of node.
	it give elements in sequence formet.
	
	Example:
	
	Queue<String> string = new LinkedList<>() ;
	Iterator itr = string.iterator() ;
	while(itr.hasNext()){
		String str = itr.next() ;
		System.out.println(str) ;
		}
