
Q2) What is the difference between ArrayList and Array?


Array : 
	
	Array is nothing but the reference object which can store multiple object.
	To store multiple object in a single object we use array.
	Array is fixed in size.
	There is no specific method inside the array.
	Even to print Array we need to run a loop.
	we can not increase or decrease the size of array unless creating new array.
	
	Ex. 
		int[] arr = new int[5] //this will create the array of fixed size 5.
	
	
ArrayList : 
	ArrayList is one implementation of collection Interface.
	Arraylist also implement the List interface.
	One of the biggest difference between ArrayList and Array is that ArrayList is dynamic in size.
	We can increase the size of the ArrayList.
	As ArrayList implement the collection and List so we have all the method we can use on ArrayList.
	Like Add , remove, get, indexOf etc.
	
	ArrayList<Integer> list = new ArrayList<Integer>() ; // this will create a list of default size 10 which can be increase.
	
	ArrayList<Integer> list1 = new ArrayList<Integer>(5) ; // this will create a list of manual size 5 which can be increase.
