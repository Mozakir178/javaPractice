AutoBoxing:
	As we know collection does not support the premetive data type.
	So if want to use premative data type inside collection we need to change those premative data type.
	We also know that for every premative data type there is wrapper class in java.
	So converting the premative data type into the respected wrapper class is nothing but the Boxing.
	Before java 1.5 we needed to do it manually. 
	But in java 1.5 Auto Boxing and unboxing is introduce.
	Now we can change the premative data type into respected wrapper class autometically.
	This is nothing but Auto Boxing.
	
	Ex. 
		Before Java 1.5 ;
		int i = 10 ;
		Integer i1 = Integer.valueOf(i) ;
		
		After Java 1.5 ;
		int i = 10 ;
		Integer i1 = i ;
		This is nothing but Auto Boxing.
		
		
Auto UnBoxing:
	Some time we need to perform some methometical or other operation which can not perform on wrapper class.
	Then we need to change the wrapper class into the premative data type.
	So converting the wrapper class object into the premative data type is nothing but the Unbocxing.
	Again before Java 1.5 the unboxing was manual. 
	But now we can Autometically convert the wrapper class into premative data type.
	Converting the wrapper class into respected premetive data type. 
	This process is nothing but Auto unboxing.
	 
	 Ex.
	 	Before Java 1.5 
	 	Integer i1 = 10 ;
	 	int i = Integer.intValue(i1) ;
	 	
	 	After Java 1.5 
	 	Integer i1 = 10 ;
	 	int i = i1 ;
	 	This is nothing but Auto Unboxing.
