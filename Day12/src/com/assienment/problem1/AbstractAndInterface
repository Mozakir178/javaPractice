		Abstract class is a restricted class from which you can not make an object directly.
		Abstract class must be extends by any child class.
		Abstract class is used to achive half polymorphism.
		Abstract class may or may not have an abstract method.
		If there is any abstract method in your abstract class then this method must be override.
		Abstract class does not support multiple inheritance.
		Abstract class can have final non final static non static variables.
		Abstract class can implements interface.
		
			Ex.
				public abstract class AbstractClass{
				
				}

		
Interface:
		Interface is also restricted.You can not create object directly.
		Interface needs to be implements.
		Interface can only have abstract method. after java 8 it can have static and default also.
		Interface has only static and final variable.
		Interface support multiple inheritance.
		Interface can't extends any class but it can extends a interface.
		You need to override all the abstract method of the Interface in the class which is implimenting the interface.
		
			Ex.
				public abstract interface Interface{
				
				}
