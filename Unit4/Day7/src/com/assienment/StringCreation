        Is there any difference between creating a string with and without a new operator?  
        Explain with an example.

        Ans )
        	In JAVA there are 2 method in which you can create String object.
        	1- Direct or without new Operator ;
        	2- Object Creation or using new Operator ;
        	
        	1- Direct or without new Operator : 
        		This is one of the method of declaring the String variable.
        		In this method you simply need to Write String keyword after that write identifier.
        		And after that simply write the String in double quote i.e. " "  ;
        		When we declare String using this method only one object get created .
        		And this String get its memory in the String constant pool area.
        		When we declare Same string again then this String value is get assign to that variable also.
        		
        		
        	Ex.
        		String str1 = "This is str1" ;
        		
        	2- Object creation or using new Operator : 
        		This is the second method of creating the String object.
        		In this method we create String same as creating any other object.
        		First we write String after that identifier.
        		Then we write new key word then inside constructor we write our string in double quote.
        		When we Declare String using this method two object get created.
        		One in the String constant pool area.
        		Second inside heap memory.
        		
        		Ex.
        			String str2 = new String("This is str2") ;
