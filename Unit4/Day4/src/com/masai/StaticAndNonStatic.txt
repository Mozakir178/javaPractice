Static Variable :-
	 When any variable is declare with the keyword static inside class and outside any method it is called as Static Variable.
	 Static variable also call as Class variable.
	 Static variable always get memory in the ram at compilation phase.
	 we can directly call Static variable inside a method of same class. 
	 we can directly call static variable with class name inside other class.
	 Static variable share the same value for all the object created using same class.
	 It means if value of Static variable change in one object it will reflect on other objects of same class as well.
	 
	 
Non-Static Variable :-
	 When a variable is declare without static keyword inside a class and outside of any function this variable is called as Non-Static variable.
	 Non-Static variable also called as Instance variable.
	 Non-Static variable are only get memory in ram when we invoke them.
	 We can not directly access this non-static variable inside any method or class.
	 To use this variable we need to create the object of the same class so that all non-static variable could load in the ram.
	 To use non-static variable we need to use the name of the object.
	 Non-Static variable contain different value for different object.
	 Means for object1 the value of non static variable is different and for object2 value of non static variable is different.
