	Java only support Single Inheritance on class level.
	Java does not support Multiple Inheritance.
	As we all know that in java we can only extends a single class.
	In this way we can only inherited 1 class at max.
	So we can not inherited more than 1 class at a time that is why multiple inheritance is not supported in java.
	But we can achieve this multiple inheritance using the interface.
	We can implements as many interface as we  want.
	so this is why Java does not support Multiple inheritance.
	

	ex: 
		public class Child extends Parent{
		
		}
		
		public class Ch1 extends P1, p2{ // this will give error.
		}
		
		public class Ch2 extends p1 implement I1, I2,I3{  //It will work
		
		}
