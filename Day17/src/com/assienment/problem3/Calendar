
Date and Time API ;
	In java language we have a special API to handle all the work related to the date and time.
	We can perform so many task on date and time with the help of this API.
	Similarly we can add remove date from the current date.
	To add date we simple need to use the API's inbuild method.
	
	To add the Weeks in the current date we have different method.
	We are using simplest one.
	In this we just need to create one object of LocatDate class with current date.
	Then we can use the inbuild method to add weeks , months and years.
	
	
		LocalDate now = LocalDate.now() ;
		LocalDate week = now.plusWeeks(1) ;
		LocalDate month = now.plusMonths(1) ;
		LocalDate year = now.plusYears(1) ;
		
		System.out.println("Current date is: "+now)  ;
		System.out.println("Date after 1 week: "+week) ;
		System.out.println("Date after 1 month: "+month) ; 
		System.out.println("Date after 1 year: "+year) ;
