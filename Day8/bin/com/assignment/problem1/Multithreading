		Consider a application is runnig which contain so many method.
		Lets say a perticular method take 2 hour to complete counting of N number.
		as this task is getting done in backgroud.
		Processor is in idle condition for that perticular time.
		So when processor is in idle condition we can start some other task.
		In that way we can utilize the idle condition of processor and it can  make our application fast.
		This is called Multithreading.
		
		
		Importance:
			Multithreading reduce the time of our program.
			we can utilize full potentioal of the processor.
			This process is cheap as compair to process shedular.
