	Runnable is an interface which contain the run method.
	We need run() method to apply the concept of multithreading.
	We implement all the logic and method we want to run simulteniously in run() method.
	We cannot directly call run method. 
	For that we need start() method.
	That is why we need Thread class to call run method.
	When we implement runneble on any class we can also implements and extends other classes and interface.
	
	
	class A implements Runneble{
	
	public void run(){
	
	System.out.println("we write logic here") ;
	}
	}
	
	
Thread class:
	Thread is a class which is present in java.lang package.
	Thread class also implements Runneble interface.
	So when we extend Thread class we don't need to implements Runneble.
	But we need to Override run method.
	Because Thread class implemention of run() method is just empty {} ;
	when we extends Thread class we can not extends other class.
	So we loss very important concept of inharitance.
	We can not use throws keyword when we use Thread class.
	
	
	class A extends Thread{
	
	public void start() {
	
	run()
	}
	}
