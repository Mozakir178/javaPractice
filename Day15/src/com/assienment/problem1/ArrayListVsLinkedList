	ArrayList is implementaion of the List as well as the Collection.
	But ArrayList don't have its own method.
	ArrayList is one of the most used Collection.
	It just implements the interface.
	ArrayList is flexible in size.
	ArrayList provide index based access.
	ArrayList take O(N) time complexity to perform add at perticular index.
	ArrayList mentain the order of insertion.
	
	
	Ex.
		List<Integer> arrayList = new ArrayList<>() ;
		
	we have created the ArrayList with default length of 10.
	
	
LinkedList:
	LinkedList is also the implementation of the List and Collection.
	LinkedList also implements Deque interface.
	But LinkedList have its own method also.
	It is also very Importent Collection type.
	LinkedLlist is also flexible in size.
	When we add new element it add that element in the form of node.
	Because of this advantage when we add a perticular element it only take O(N).
	LinkedList also mantain the order of insertion.
	
	Ex.
		List<Integer> linkedList = new LinkedList<>() ;
		we have created the empty linkedlist.
