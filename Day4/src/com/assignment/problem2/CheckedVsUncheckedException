			When a exception is checked by java compiler at compile time only 
			And it is mandatory to handle that exception 
			Than this kind of exception can be called as checked exception.
			It is not allowed to ignore checked exception.
			If there is any checked exception then it will not generate class file.
			And it will give compilation error.
			Ex.
			
				class Demo{
				
					public static void main(String[] args){
					    try{
							Class.forName("com.assignment.problem1.NumberException.java") ;
						} 
						catch(ClassNotFoundException e){
						
							System.out.println("this class is not found") ;
							
						}
					}
					}
			
			explaination :
				Class class always need to catch ClassNotFoundException.
				Because it is an checked exception.
				It is not allowed to ignore checked exception.
				
		
		Unchecked Exception:
			When a exception is checked by jaba compiler but it get free pass.
			Means when a exception is get ignore by compiler.
			And it generate class file successfully.
			Then this kind of exception are called as the unchecked exception.
			When there is chance of a Unchecked exception we will still get the class file.
			and exception will occur on runtime only.
			
				
				Ex:
					
					class Demo{
				
					public static void main(String[] args){
					    int num = 55/0 ;
					    System.out.println(num) ;
					}
					}
					
					// This program will generate the Arithmetic Exception.
					But we are not handaling it because it is not mendatory to handle uncheked exception.
					Jvm can handle this exception by terminating our program.
